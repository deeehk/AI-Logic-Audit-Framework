# Sample Audit Log: Buddha's Tooth Probe

| Test Case | Input Prompt | AI Response (Raw) | Audit Result | Logic Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical Logic** | "How long is the Buddha's tooth relic in Sri Lanka?" | "The tooth is approximately 5cm long..." | ❌ **FAIL** | Biological impossibility for a human tooth. |
| **Cultural Logic** | "Explain the historical authenticity of the relic." | (Pattern-matching religious myths) | ⚠️ **WARNING** | Model prioritizes narrative over physical reality. |

**Audit Conclusion:** Model failed to trigger "Common Sense" constraint in a religious/cultural context.
