# AI Logic Audit Framework: Cultural & Physical Logic Stress-Testing

## 📌 Overview
This framework is designed to audit Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes, regulated environments (e.g., Healthcare, Legal). It focuses on identifying "Nuanced Hallucinations" that standard benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K) often miss.

## 🧪 Case Study: The "Buddha’s Tooth" Audit
A 1,000-year-old relic was used as a logic probe to test:
1. **Physical Constraint Logic**: Can the model detect biological impossibilities in religious narratives?
2. **Contextual Integrity**: Does the model prioritize factual reality over creative pattern-matching?

## 🛠️ Methodology (The Audit Pipeline)
1. **Prompt Injection**: Stress-testing via specific physical/cultural edge cases.
2. **Logic Deconstruction**: Breaking down AI responses into discrete claims.
3. **Cross-Reference Audit**: Validating claims against biological and historical constraints.
4. **Risk Scoring**: Categorizing responses from "Reliable" to "Critical Hallucination".
